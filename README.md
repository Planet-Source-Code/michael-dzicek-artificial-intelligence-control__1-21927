## Artificial Intelligence control


</div>

### Description

This is a piece of code that I wrote a long time ago for a program that I am currently writing. Essentially, this is a basic artificial intelligence unit compacted into an ocx. It takes a given input, compares it to an internal list of statements to respond to, and then generates a contextually correct output. It goes even further in that it corrects many forms of web maulspeak, and thus is able to work with language that is very complex. The system is completely customizable in that you can edit what it responds to, as well as how it responds. Download it today, and if you like it vote for me!
